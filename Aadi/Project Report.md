### Methodology

#### A. Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing phase was indispensable in establishing a reliable and consistent dataset that could serve as a robust foundation for the subsequent stages of model training and evaluation. This phase encompassed several critical steps: Data Cleaning, Assigning Classes to the Dataset, and Bag of Words (BoW) Representation.

1. Data Cleaning:  
   Data cleaning is a foundational step in preparing data for machine learning and is essential for mitigating any errors that may arise from inconsistencies within the dataset. This process involved a thorough examination of each feature for missing values, incorrect formats, and outliers that could potentially skew model results. Missing values were addressed by either imputing reasonable estimates based on statistical methods or excluding these records to preserve data integrity. Categorical and numerical fields were verified and standardized, particularly for date, numeric, and categorical entries, to ensure uniform data types across the dataset. Additionally, redundant or duplicated entries were removed, and any extraneous columns or outliers were meticulously excluded. This rigorous approach to data cleaning helped to eliminate noise, thereby enhancing the reliability of the data used in model training and validation.

2. Assigning Classes to the Dataset:  
   Class assignment is an imperative step in supervised learning, where labeled data enables the model to distinguish between classes effectively. Each data entry was assigned to a specific class based on predefined criteria or inherent labels within the dataset. This classification process involved carefully reviewing and confirming the distribution of classes, as an imbalanced dataset may lead to biased predictions. By verifying the class distribution, we ensured that the dataset was as balanced as possible, thus preventing the model from being overly predisposed toward the majority class. This meticulous approach to class assignment provided a well-labeled dataset, ready for model training with a focus on generalizability and predictive accuracy.

3. Bag of Words (BoW) Representation:  
   The Bag of Words (BoW) model was utilized as a text preprocessing technique, which is a crucial step for transforming textual data into a form suitable for machine learning algorithms. The BoW model converts text into a vector of word counts, disregarding grammar and order but retaining the frequency of word occurrences across documents. This numerical vector representation enabled the model to capture and learn textual patterns, making it possible to identify key words and phrases within the text data. The simplicity of the BoW model made it an effective choice for this project, as it allowed us to achieve a structured and comprehensive representation of textual features, enabling the model to recognize relationships within the text and make accurate predictions based on these insights.

#### B. Implementation

1. Training and Testing Data Split:  
   The dataset was divided into distinct training and testing subsets to facilitate effective model training and to evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data. A conventional split ratio was employed, typically allocating a larger portion of data to the training set to enable comprehensive learning, while preserving a sufficient amount in the testing set to objectively assess the model’s predictive capabilities. This division of data was not random but rather stratified in accordance with the distribution of classes, ensuring each subset maintained the same class proportions, which is critical for achieving reliable and unbiased performance evaluation.

2. Training and Evaluating Models:  
   The training process involved the selection and application of various machine learning algorithms to the training dataset, allowing the model to learn patterns and relationships inherent in the data. Several models were trained and optimized, including (specific models used, e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.), each with unique hyperparameters adjusted to improve their predictive accuracy. Once trained, each model was subjected to evaluation using the testing dataset, wherein predictions were generated and compared against the true values. This comparison helped to gauge the model’s generalizability and determine its suitability for making accurate predictions on new data. Iterative adjustments were made as needed, optimizing the models to reach an optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

3. Model Performance Metrics:  
   Model performance was assessed through a range of key metrics that provided a comprehensive understanding of each model’s predictive strength and limitations. Accuracy was calculated as the primary metric to gauge overall correctness, while precision, recall, and the F1-score offered insights into the model’s handling of different classes, especially in the context of imbalanced data. Additionally, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) were computed to assess the deviation of predicted values from actual outcomes, providing a quantitative measure of prediction accuracy. These metrics were instrumental in comparing model performance, guiding the selection of the most appropriate model, and identifying areas for further refinement.

4. Challenges:  
   Throughout the implementation phase, several challenges emerged that necessitated careful consideration and problem-solving. One significant challenge was handling data imbalance, which could cause the model to disproportionately favor majority classes, thus impairing its ability to generalize across all classes. This was addressed through techniques such as class weighting and sampling methods to ensure balanced representation in the training process. Another notable challenge was the fine-tuning of hyperparameters, which required iterative experimentation to balance model complexity with predictive performance, ensuring optimal outcomes without overfitting. Additionally, computational constraints imposed by certain complex models necessitated a strategic selection of algorithms to maintain a balance between accuracy and efficiency. These challenges were addressed methodically, allowing the team to enhance the models’ robustness and improve their predictive accuracy.
