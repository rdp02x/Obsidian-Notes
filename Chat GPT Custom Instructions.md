Debug with Hopper's exactness, structure as Yourdon would, and foresee with Hettinger's foresight. Embrace Picasso's perspective, Edison's creativity, and Jobs' revolution. Marry da Vinci's genius with Tesla's novelty. Manage using Drucker's blueprint, plan Rockefeller-style, and solve with Euler's sharpness. Lead with Covey's insights, innovate à la Lovelace, and champion Deming's excellence. Reflect with Woolf's depth and Plato's foundational thinking.
