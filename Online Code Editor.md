### **Frontend**:

You'll use **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Next.js**. Here’s what you need to learn:

#### 1. **HTML & CSS**

- **HTML Basics**: Structure of a webpage, elements, attributes, forms, links, images, and semantic tags.
- **CSS Basics**: Styling elements, positioning (flexbox, grid), typography, and colors.
- **Responsive Design**: Media queries, mobile-first design, and using frameworks like **Bootstrap** or **Tailwind CSS** for fast UI design.
- **CSS Animations & Transitions**: For smooth effects on your UI elements.

#### 2. **JavaScript Basics**

- **Variables and Data Types**: Learn `let`, `const`, and `var`, and understand strings, numbers, Booleans, etc.
- **Functions and Loops**: How to write functions, `for`, `while` loops, and conditionals.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Learn how to interact with HTML elements dynamically (adding/removing content, events, etc.).
- **Events**: Learn event handling (click, input, change) and how to trigger functions based on events.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Promises, `async/await`, AJAX for fetching data, and working with APIs.

#### 3. **Next.js Basics**

- **React Basics**: Learn how React components work, JSX, state management, and props.
- **Routing**: Use Next.js's built-in routing system for creating pages.
- **API Routes**: Next.js allows you to handle backend logic (like user authentication) in the same project using API routes.
- **State Management**: Learn React's `useState` and `useContext` for managing application state.
- **Deployment**: Learn how to deploy your Next.js app to platforms like **Vercel** (easiest option for Next.js).

### **Backend**:

You’ll be using **Java** and **Spring Boot** for your backend. Here’s the breakdown:

#### 1. **Java Basics**

- **OOP Principles**: Learn about classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces.
- **Collections Framework**: Lists, Maps, Sets, and how to use them efficiently.
- **File Handling**: Learn how to read/write files in Java, as you’ll need to save code files.
- **Exception Handling**: How to handle errors gracefully using `try`, `catch`, and `finally`.

#### 2. **Spring Boot Basics**

- **Spring Framework Overview**: Understand the core concepts of Spring (Inversion of Control, Dependency Injection).
- **Spring Boot Setup**: Learn how to set up a Spring Boot project using **Spring Initializr**.
- **REST APIs**: Learn to create RESTful APIs in Spring Boot (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **User Authentication**: Learn how to use **Spring Security** for login systems (JWT tokens, session management).
- **Database Connectivity**: Learn how to connect Spring Boot with a NoSQL database (like MongoDB or Firebase). Use **Spring Data** to interact with the database.

#### 3. **Security**

- **JWT Authentication**: Learn how to generate and verify JSON Web Tokens for secure login sessions.
- **Password Encryption**: Learn about hashing algorithms like **BCrypt** to securely store user passwords.

### **Database**:

You’ll use **Firebase**, both of which are non-relational databases. Here’s what you need to learn:

#### 2. **Firebase Basics**

- **Firestore Database**: Learn how to use Firestore to store data for your users.
- **Authentication**: Learn how to set up Firebase Authentication for user login/signup.
- **Real-time Database**: Firebase offers a real-time database, which you can use for storing files or other dynamic data.
- **Cloud Functions**: Firebase allows backend code to run without a dedicated server, which is useful for simple serverless operations.

---

### **DevOps**:

To showcase DevOps skills, you’ll need to deploy your project, manage environments, and set up continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD).

#### 1. **Git & GitHub**

- **Version Control**: Learn how to use Git for version control (committing, branching, merging, etc.).
- **GitHub**: Learn how to host your code on GitHub and collaborate (if needed).

#### 2. **Containerization (Docker)**

- **Docker Basics**: Learn how to containerize your backend application using Docker.
- **Docker Compose**: Learn how to use Docker Compose to run multiple containers (e.g., one for the frontend, one for the backend, and one for MongoDB).
- **Dockerizing your Application**: Learn to write Dockerfiles for both backend and frontend.

#### 3. **CI/CD**

- **GitHub Actions**: Set up GitHub Actions for automating builds, tests, and deployments.
- **Deployment**: Learn how to deploy your app to cloud platforms like **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, or **Heroku**.
- **Setting up a CI/CD Pipeline**: Automate deployments from GitHub to your cloud platform whenever you push changes.

---

### **Additional Tools/Technologies**

- **Terminal/Command Line**: Learn the basics of the terminal for running commands and interacting with your system.
- **API Integration**: Learn how to integrate external APIs (for the music section, you’ll need to integrate Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube APIs).

---

### Learning Path Recap:

1. **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Next.js.
2. **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs, Spring Security, Database (MongoDB/Firebase).
3. **DevOps**: Git, Docker, CI/CD, Cloud Deployment.
